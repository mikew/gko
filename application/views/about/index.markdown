We realize that games are first and foremost about fun and our greatest ambition is to create only the most enjoyable and amusing playware.

The **KDEGames** team achieves this goal by paying greater attention to gaming details, using the latest **KDE** based technology, and listening closely to our users' feedback.

To date **KDEGames** has accumulated an impressive selection of quality games in nearly all genres. Each of these small masterpieces has been carefully tailored to satisfy the demands of all, even the most pretentious gamers.

Additionally, we want you to remember that a large part of our success comes from careful and considerate review of users' feedback and comments.
